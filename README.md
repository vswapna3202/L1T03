## L1T03: The String and Numerical Data type ##
The following python programs uses variables which are String or Numerical data types. Various methods are used to manipulate these data types<br>

**1. Replacing String variables:**
This program replaces ! in a string sentence with space and also prints it in
upper case. Uses string methods replace() and upper()<br>

**2. String maniuplations:**
This program takes a string sentence as an input and replaces the last letter of each word in the sentence with @ and prints the last three letters and creates a 5 letter word with the first 3 letters and last letters of the string.<br>

**3. Numerical operations:**
This program asks the user to input 3 different integers and performs various numerical operations with these numbers like sum of all numbers, difference between first and second number, third number multiplied by first number, sum of all three numbers divided by the third number. <br>

**4. Area of a triangle(Optional Task):**
This program asks user to enter the three sides of a triangle and calculates its area and prints it. Formula used for calculating area is:
    ■ s = (side1 + side2 + side3)/2 and
    ■ area = √(s(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))<br>
    
**5. User's favourite restaurant(Optional Task):**    
This program asks user to input their favourite restaurant, their favourite number. Print these out and then try casting the string to the integer variable and record what is the output. An error will be obtained which is explained as comment in the code.
